# Architecture

this application is having two points in its architecture. the client and the server. to fire up server side API, navigate to the API folder using `cd api`, and then run `npm run dev`, and dont forget to start your mongoDb server.

To fireup the frontend, navigate to the public folder using `cd public` and install the npm package as live-server using `nodemon install -g live-server`, (prefix sudo `sudo npm i -g live-server`), and in the public folder, open terminal and write `live-server`, and your full fledged application would run on port 8080.

# how is the app created

The app is created mainly using node.js as the backend server, and at the frontend, we have used html, css and vanilla javascript. As the database, we have used mongoDb.
